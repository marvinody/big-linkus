# git-stalked
Still a WIP, so bare with me. The functionality is somewhat there, just in pieces

The interesting stuff is in [/git](https://stalker.deploy.sadpanda.moe/git/) and [/git/\<user>/\<repo>](https://stalker.deploy.sadpanda.moe/git/marvinody/git-stalked). Mainly the second one for the time being...

# How?
Basic idea is to clone the repository and go through all the commits checking for any emails associated with the commits. Then clean it up a bit and send them back.

# But...Why?
It's public information that people tend to willingly supply to Github and I thought it would be a fun project to try my hand at.
